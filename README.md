Covid-Analysis - Data Exploration using Postgresql(pgAdmin4)

I have used PostgreSQL for the first time to perform my data exploration where in I have created database, schemas, imported data from csv files
Skills used: JOINS, AGGREGATE FUNCTION, CTE, TEMP TABLES, VIEWS, CHANGING DATA TYPES

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The data set was quite vast and has lot more things to divein for future analysis. 

I am open for all the feebacks and improvement so that I can learn more. Hope this is helpfull to any new bee like me....
Happy coding :)
