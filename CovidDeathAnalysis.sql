----- let us now join the other table to get vaccination data aswell

select * 
from "Covid"."CovidDeaths" dea
join "Covid"."CovidVaccinations" vac
   on dea.location = vac.location
   and dea.date = vac.date
   
   
-------looking at total population vs vaccinations

--------New vaccination rooling count by location and date
select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
  SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) 
  OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
from "Covid"."CovidDeaths" dea
join "Covid"."CovidVaccinations" vac
   on dea.location = vac.location
   and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is  not null
 order by 1, 2, 3
 
----USE CTE
-----Calculate the rolling percentage of people vaccinated
-----We use CTE to apply aggregate function on the column created out of aggregate function

WITH PopvsVac(Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_vaccinations,RollingPeopleVaccinated)

select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 AS Rolling_percentageVaccinated

-----USE TEMTABLE

----We will use temp tables to calculate the rolling percentage 
----- of people who are fully vaccinated by Location
Drop table if exists percentage_fully-vaccinated
Create Temporary Table percentage_fully_vaccinated
(
continent character(100),
location character(100),
population bigint,
people_fully_vaccinated bigint,
rollingfullyvaccinated numeric
);
Insert into percentage_fully_vaccinated
(

SUM(vac.people_fully_vaccinated) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location) as RollingFullyVaccinated
 from "Covid"."CovidDeaths" dea

   on dea.location = vac.location
where dea.continent is  not null
ORDER BY 1, 2
);
select *, (rollingfullyvaccinated/population)*100 AS Rolling_percentage_fully_Vaccinated

----- create view to use it for our future analysis and visualisation

Create view "Covid"."percentage_fully_vaccinated" as
